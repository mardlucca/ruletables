# ruletables
This is a simple rules engine implementation based on ideas from "iptables". This is meant to be a generic library written in Java. This library/API can then be further enhanced/extended to included any desired functionality like an expression language or script to allow users to write rules using the engine.

This is a work in progress. I have barely started it.
